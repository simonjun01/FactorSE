Details of the 8-factor model (M8)


Applying our proposed stepwise evaluation approach, we select 8 factors, referred to as the `M8 model`, which are summarized below.

1. Description of the M8 model
MKT: Excess market return 
REG: Expected growth
PEAD: Post-earnings announcement drift
HMLM: HML Devil
STR: Short-term reversal on prior (1-1)
ILR: Industry lead-lag effect in prior returns
SMB: Small minus big 
EPRD: Earnings predictability

ILR: 1-way sorts:  Ilr1 ("ilr_1"), industry lead-lag effect in prior returns, 1-month holding period;
EPRD: 1-way sorts: Eprd ("eprd"), earnings predictability;
Calculation Method: 1-way sorts, take max quantile minus min quantile. If the calculated factor return is negative, we need to adjust the sign (multiply by -1) to make it a positive-return factor.
