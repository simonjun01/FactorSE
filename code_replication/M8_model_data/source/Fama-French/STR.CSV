This file was created by CMPT_ME_PRIOR_RETS using the 202212 CRSP database.  It,,
contains a momentum factor, constructed from six value-weight portfolios formed,
using independent sorts on size and prior return of NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks.
ST_Rev is the average of the returns on two (big and small) low prior return portfolios,,
minus the average of the returns on two high prior return portfolios.  The portfolios,,
are constructed monthly.  Big means a firm is above the median market cap on the NYSE,,
at the end of the previous month; small firms are below the median NYSE market cap.,,
Prior return is measured from month - 1 to - 1.  Firms in the low prior return,,
portfolio are below the 30th NYSE percentile.  Those in the high portfolio are above,,
the 70th NYSE percentile.,,
,,
Missing data are indicated by -99.99 or -999.,,
